proxy? to list thing on modal without waiting locked - DONE

when using the feature two consecutive times on the same image, something goes wrong - DONE (puff problem went somewhere far and never came back)

color svg's are too dim. To make them bolder, analyze and correct all path opacity from svg's. - DONE (looks dope af)
